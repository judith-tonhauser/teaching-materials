\maketitle

This chapter discussed three notions of meaning and (diagnostic) tests that identify them. It also introduces two types of arguments.

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Entailment is a type of 
   \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
       \item implicature (0 pts)
        \item implication (1 pt)
           \item presupposition (0 pts)
   \end{enumerate}
    \item Is the following statement true or false? Conversational implicatures can be cancelled without producing a contradiction. 
   \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
        \item True (1pt)
        \item False (0pts)
    \end{enumerate}
 \item What is the relatioship between sentence A and sentence B?
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex The book that John bought was on sale.
\ex John bought a book.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
   \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
        \item Entailment (0pts)
        \item Implication (0pts)
         \item Implicature (0pts)
           \item Presupposition (1pt)
    \end{enumerate}

 \item What is the relatioship between sentence A and sentence B?
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex  The flying saucer came yesterday.
\ex The flying saucer has come sometime in the past.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
   \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
        \item Entailment (1pt)
        \item Implication (0pts)
         \item Implicature (0pts)
           \item Presupposition (0pts)
    \end{enumerate}


 \item What is the relationship between sentence A and sentence B?

\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex  The flying saucer came again.
\ex The flying saucer has come sometime in the past.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
   \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
        \item Entailment (0pts)
        \item Implication (0pts)
         \item Implicature (0pts)
           \item Presupposition (1pt)
    \end{enumerate}
    
\item Is the following argument valid / sound?
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex All telephone-booths are blue.
\ex All blue items are time-travel devices.
\ex Therefore, all telephone-booths are time-travel devices.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
 \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Valid? Yes (1pt) No (0pts)
    \item Sound? Yes (0pts) No (1pt)
\end{enumerate}

\item Is the following argument valid / sound?

\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex 2 + 2 = 4.
\ex Therefore, Paris is in Europe.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
 \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Valid? Yes (0pts) No (1pt)
    \item Sound? Yes (0pts) No (1pt)
\end{enumerate}

\item Is the following argument valid and sound?
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex Copenhagen is either in Denmark or in the Netherlands.
\ex Copenhagen is not in the Netherlands.
\ex Therefore, Copenhagen is in Denmark.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
 \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Valid? Yes (1pt) No (0pts)
    \item Sound? Yes (1pt) No (0pts)
\end{enumerate}

 \item Choose the correct word: A sentence A entails a sentence B iff whenever A is $\frac{true (1pt)}{false (0pts)}$, B is $\frac{true (1pt)}{false (0pts)}$ too. 

\item If a sentence A and its negation B are  $\frac{contradictory (1pt)}{contrary (0pts)}$, then sentence A entails sentence B. 

\item For the three sentences below determine whether they stand in contrary or contradictory relation to \textit{Everybody danced.}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textit{It is not the case that everybody danced.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Contrary (0pts)
        \item Contradiction (1pt)
    \end{enumerate}
     \item \textit{Not everybody danced.}
         \begin{enumerate}
        \item Contrary (0pts)
        \item Contradiction (1pt)
    \end{enumerate}
     \item \textit{Nobody danced.}
         \begin{enumerate}
        \item Contrary (1pt)
        \item Contradiction (0pt)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\item For the two sentences below determine whether they stand in contrary or contradictory relation to \textit{I always dance.}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textit{It is not the case that I always dance.}
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item Contrary (0pts)
        \item Contradiction (1pt)
    \end{enumerate}
     \item \textit{I never dance.}
         \begin{enumerate}
        \item Contrary (1pt)
        \item Contradiction (0pts)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\item Based on the diagnostic test, does sentence A entail sentence B? 
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex Every dog barked.
\ex Every chihuahua barked.
\ex Every dog barked. \#In fact, not every chihuahua barked.
\end{xlist}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Yes, sentence A entails sentence B. (1pt)
    \item No, sentence A does not entail sentence B. (0pts)
\end{enumerate}

\end{exe}




\end{enumerate}
