{\bf Goals of the course:} The meanings conveyed by natural language
utterances are subtle and complex, arising as a function of the
conventional content of the expressions uttered and of various contextual
factors. Semantics is the study of the conventional system itself, while
pragmatics studies how context plays a role in conveying meaning. This
course is an introduction to the study of meaning, i.e., semantics and
pragmatics.

{\bf Assessment:}

\vspace*{-.3cm}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=3ex]

\item {\bf  Homework assignments} (ungraded VL): There will be three short ungraded homework assignments, to help prepare you for the final exam. You will upload your assignments to a folder on ILIAS and we will discuss the answers in class. 

\item {\bf In-class final exam}: In the last class meeting, there will be a cumulative final exam (open book, open notes). The term `open book' means that you can bring the assigned readings; the term `open notes' means that you can bring your notes.

\end{enumerate}
