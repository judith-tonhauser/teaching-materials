Todo list

- move all of Elena's students into Judith's ILIAS course (Elena already has privileges); it needs to be my course because I have PH student

- Elena: tell waitlist students (which?) to sign up for my course on c@mpus so that we have the same amount of students to grade

- what are all the ways in which we will interact in the course? (include this info in syllabus), whose face will they see/voice will they hear for what?

- communicate with students: Semantic Theory A and B will be online and joint; send syllabus; give first info also (joint on ILIAS, separate on c@mpus and for purpose of pruefung)

- what will we do in each week? screencast on chapter (important and difficult concepts), online quiz, model answer for quiz, respond to ILIAS questions on reading and on quiz questions (on ILIAS only or another screencast?)

- what will we do during regular course time? offer office hours? prepare screencasts?

- think about whether we want to do the weekly HW online. advantage is immediate feedback for students, but will we be able to use all the symbols we need? upload pictures?
