Draft introductory message for each quiz where we describe what is important

Clarify that weekly quizzes are available for several days, but once they start, they only have 90 minutes to get them used to it for the final. This means: first study then test.

Quiz settings to discuss:

- Administering the text: access. Starting time: 20.4. 9am. Finishing time: 21.4. noon?.

- Limit Number of Test Passes: Maximum number of passes: 1 

- Limit Duration of Test: 90 minutes for final and weekly quizzes

- Show question title and points, yes?
- Automatic saving: every 60 seconds?
- Shuffle questions: will make collaborating on final more difficult, but do we want it for the weekly quizzes, where they might want to work together?
- Do not lock participants' answers?
- Suspend test: allow for weekly quizzes? for final?
- Overview of answers given: PDF, so they can compare their answers to the model answers
- Concluding remarks? Good job on taking the weekly quiz!
