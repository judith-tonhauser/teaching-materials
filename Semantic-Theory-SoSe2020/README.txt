README

This directory includes 
- the course syllabus
- a folder for online exercises and model answers
- a folder for screencasts, with notes for what we need to talk about


Todo list

- move all of Elena's students into Judith's ILIAS course (Elena already has privileges); it needs to be my course because I have PH student

- Elena: tell waitlist students (which?) to sign up for my course on c@mpus so that we have the same amount of students to grade

- what are all the ways in which we will interact in the course? (include this info in syllabus): screencasts for reading and exercise for the week, feedback on weekly exercise, office hours

BY APRIL 15: Semantic Theory A and B will be online and joint; send syllabus; give first info also (joint on ILIAS, separate on c@mpus and for purpose of pruefung)

BY APRIL 21 (T): POST SYLLABUS
April 15 meeting:
- think about how to cover book until chapter 3.6.2 (how many classes?)
- which readings for tense and aspect?
- read ILIAS description for online test
Finalize syllabus
Create draft syllabus quiz


BY APRIL 23 (R)
April 17 meeting:
- draft possible questions (in latex and answer key) for first reading (chapter 1.1)
- put together exercise ch1.1

- assessment: online final exam

- ch1.1: inferences, implication, implication versus implicature, question under discussion, three types of meaning (entailment, presupposition, conversational implicature), three tests/diagnostics (defeasibility test: entailment/ps versus implicature; reinforcement test: entailment/ps versus implicature; projection), what does it mean to "cancel" a meaning?, for defeasibility test: contrary versus contradiction, what does & mean?, Figure 1.1

- Week 2 (T): screencast for ch 1.2; assignment: read ch 1.2 and take quiz by week 3 (T)

- Week 3 (T)

Task in each week:

1. create exercise and model answer key (EV takes lead in odd weeks, JT in even weeks; finalize on late T or early W)
2. create online exercise (EV on W)
3. reading issues to be addressed in screencast (EV sends JT input via email by T evening)
4. create screencast for reading and exercise (JT creates on W)
5. assess student problems based on quiz (JT)
6. monitor ILIAS forum for the week (EV)
7. respond to exercise/forum (ILIAS, email, screencast) (EV takes lead in odd weeks, JT in even weeks)
